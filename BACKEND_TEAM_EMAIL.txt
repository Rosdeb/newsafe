Subject: Socket.IO Ping Timeout - Configuration Fix Needed

Hi Backend Team,

We're experiencing frequent socket disconnections with "ping timeout" errors in our Flutter app. The server's pingTimeout setting (currently default 20s) is too short for mobile network conditions.

SOLUTION:
Please increase the Socket.IO server's pingTimeout from 20s to 60s:

Node.js:
const io = new Server(httpServer, {
  pingTimeout: 60000,  // Increase to 60s
  pingInterval: 25000,
  transports: ['websocket']
});

Python:
sio = socketio.Server(
    ping_timeout=60,   # Increase to 60s
    ping_interval=25,
    transports=['websocket']
)

This is a standard fix for mobile Socket.IO clients. The 20s default is too aggressive for mobile networks with latency variations and app backgrounding.

Priority: High
Fix Time: ~5-10 minutes (config change only)

Please deploy and let us know when it's live. Thanks!
